# AI-Document-Generator

Developed an **AI-powered document generation system** using the **Qwen-2.5(7B)** **LLM** to create 
documents such as **resumes**, **reports**, **PPTs**, and **emails** from user prompts with structured and format
specific outputs. Designed a modular pipeline for **prompt engineering**, model inference, and document 
formatting to ensure high-quality generation. Built an interactive **Streamlit-based UI** and integrated a 
**Flask** backend for local deployment via **pyngrok**, enabling seamless user interaction.
